        Hi there! My name is Hema lakshmi, and I'm the proud founder of Velvet Whisk Bakery. This isn't just a bakery; it's a dream that began in my tiny college dorm room, where my passion for baking took flight.
      </p>
      <p>Ever since I was little, I found joy in mixing flour, sugar, and a sprinkle of love to create treats that made people smile. When I started college, baking became my escape from the whirlwind of lectures and assignments. It was my way of sharing happiness with friends, neighbors, and anyone who needed a sweet pick-me-up.</p>
      <p>One day, after countless requests for my cookies and cupcakes, I decided to take the leap. Velvet Whisk Bakery was born—a place where I could pour my heart and creativity into every pastry, every loaf of bread, and every decadent cake.</p>
      <p>At Velvet Whisk, every bite tells a story. My recipes are inspired by late-night study sessions, family traditions, and flavors from travels near and far. From buttery croissants to indulgent chocolate tarts, I aim to create treats that warm your soul and brighten your day.</p>
      <p>I invite you to explore our menu, visit us in person, or simply enjoy the aroma of freshly baked bread wafting from our kitchen. Thank you for supporting a college student's dream and for being part of our journey. Let’s make life a little sweeter, one whisk at a time!</p>
